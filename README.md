# Test-Pytho
Creation of an inventory system with the following requirements:
# As an inventory operations leader, I want a system that allows me to dynamically manage a store's inventory so I can efficiently track available products, their quantity and updated prices, and calculate the total inventory value.
#____________________________
# Key Features: To achieve optimal results in this test, you will need to:
# 1. Add products to inventory: Allow the user to add products with attributes such as name, price, and available quantity.
# 2. Query products in inventory: Search for a product by name and display its details (name, price, quantity).
# 3. Update product prices: Change the price of a specific product in inventory.
# 4. Delete products from inventory: Allow the user to delete a product that is no longer available.
# 5. Calculate the total inventory value: multiply the price by the quantity of each product and display the running total.

How to use:

Initially, when you run the code, it will take you to the initial menu where you will have 6 options to choose from: 1. Add products
2. View products
3. Update product prices
4. Delete products
5. Calculate the total inventory value
6. Exit the program

The same menu will give you instructions on how to access the options. It will tell you that it only accepts option number responses. If you don't enter the desired option number, an error will appear and you will be asked to enter the correct option.
In option 1, we will have all the functions for adding products, starting with the name, price, and quantity. It is important that you correct each system validation message and check if the information was added successfully.

Once you have finished adding all the information, you can choose whether or not to continue adding, or if you want to return to the main menu.

In option 2, we will have the option to search for and view a product previously added to the list. We will be asked to enter the name to search for the product.
Once you enter the name, the product will be corrected and its details will be given, such as the name, price, and quantity in inventory.

Option 3
In this option, you can enter the name of the product you wish to view and change its price to a new one. This will help us keep our inventory up to date. Once the new price is added, you will receive a confirmation message that the value has been changed. You can use the View Product option to see the new details and product information.

Option 4: Delete products

This option allows us to enter the inventory and search for a product we want to delete. It will ask us for the name of the product to delete and give us a confirmation message.

Option 5: This option will allow us to see the total inventory value of all products, giving us a price result indicating how much money is in the inventory.

Option 6: This option will allow us to exit the program without any problems.
